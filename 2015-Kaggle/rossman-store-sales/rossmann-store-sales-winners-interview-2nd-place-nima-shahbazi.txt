==========
Were you surprised by any of your findings?
Yes, I always got surprised when even one of my finding showed better performance on the leaderboard. The most important one was when I added four more features for time series analysis. Those were simple moving averages (MA_Fast, MA_Slow, MA_Customer_Fast and MA_Customer_Slow) for sales and customers over different time windows. The moving averages were split by important feature like store number, day of week and promotion. The model I built based on moving averages blended well with my previous model and made my rank 3rd in the last week of the competition.

Which tools did you use?
For preprocessing and exploratory data analysis I used R and I usually write the code both in R and Python.

How did you spend your time on this competition?
I spent more than 70% on feature engineering, and 30% on feature selection, model ensembling, and model tuning.

What was the run time for both training and prediction of your winning solution?
I did not use a super-fast machine. For this competition I used a machine with 8-core CPU and 16GB of RAM. I ran the models in parallel on my laptop and my own desktop computer. When I woke up I started coding and digging into the data, and while I was sleeping I let the computers run my algorithm for model tuning. The winning solution has 15 models which took more than 25 hours to build and predict.
